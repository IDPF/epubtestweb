<h1>Testsuite</h1>

<p>A freely available collection of material created specifically for the purpose of testing reading systems is provided here. The source from which these downloadable publications are built can be found <a href="https://github.com/mgylling/epub-testsuite">on github</a>. Prebuilt versions are available at the bottom of this page.</p>

<h2>Instructions for evaluators</h2>

<p>If you are interested in becoming an evaluator, please contact <a href="mailto:info@bisg.org?subject=epubtest.org">info@bisg.org</a>. Once you are a registered user of this site (it's free!), your results will be stored in the central database and available for your retrieval but will not be published unless you would like to contribute to the BISG EPUB3 Support Grid (the public results available on the front page). Contact <a href="mailto:info@bisg.org?subject=epubtest.org">info@bisg.org</a> for more information on the publication process.</p>

<p>If you are not interested in becoming an evaluator, you are still encouraged to download the testsuite documents below to test your reading system.</p>

<p>The following instructions apply to logged-in users. </p>

<li>Follow the instructions for each test.</li>
<li>Back at epubtest.org, record the results for each test, using its ID to match the test in the book with the test on the website form. If the test passes, record the result as <code>Supported</code>. Otherwise, put down <code>Not Supported</code>.</li>
<li>Note that you can save an incomplete evaluation form and return to finish it later. Also note that evaluation forms autosave every 30 seconds.</li>
