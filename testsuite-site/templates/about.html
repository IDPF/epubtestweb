<h1>About</h1>

<p>This website presents a summary of Reading System performance evaluations for features in <a target="_blank" href="http://idpf.org/epub/30">EPUB 3.0</a>. The feature tests come from the <a href="/testsuite/">EPUB Testsuite</a>, a freely available collection of material created specifically for this purpose. The primary focus of the collection is on binary (pass/fail) tests. At present, the current testing process involves that evaluation and recording of results by humans (as opposed to being fully automated, since not all EPUB Reading Systems presently support JavaScript and/or network access)."</p>
